# SFML Windows Template
## How to use
1. Download the latest SFML version from the [Github](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) or from the [Website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
1. Extract the `SFML-<version number>` directory into `<ProjectSource>/SFML/<Target Platform>/`
    1. For example:
If you were to use SFML 2.5.1 and you were targeting Windows 64 bit, you would extract the contents of `SFML-2.5.1` into
`<ProjectSource>/SFML/64 bit/`
1. Thats it! This will auto-link and copy the required DLLs for you!


### Please note:
#### Release mode *does not* have a console window, but Debug mode *does*.
